# NavDemo
This Demo app allows the user to enter some data and then verify the details and populate them in another fragment.
We will be using fragments instead of the activities basically moving from one fragment to another using the navigation components of Jetpack.
The idea about this is to use the safeArgs as well as actions in order to move from one fragment to another.
